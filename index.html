    <img src="assets/images/Profile-Image.jpg" alt="Me" style="width:150px;height150px;" align="left">
    <p>I go by Andrew, Drew, or Andy. Born in Pasadena, CA and raised in San Francisco.
    I went to SFSU, and currently work at a Biotech Company in South San Francisco. I've decided
    to take coding bootcamp in order to change up my career and see what else is out there. I would 
    really like to work for a tech company because I enjoy computers, working collaboratively, and innovating.    
    </p>
    <p>Hobbies of mine include: Watching a lot of TV, movies, drinking craft beer, and going to OrangeTheoryFitness with my wife</p>
